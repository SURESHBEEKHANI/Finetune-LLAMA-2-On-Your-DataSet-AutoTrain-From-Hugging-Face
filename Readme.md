# Fine-Tuning and Inference with LLaMA-3.1-8B Model

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the LLaMA-3.1-8B model using LoRA adapters, apply chat templates, and save the model for inference. The model is trained on local data, optimized for parameter-efficient training, and deployed to the Hugging Face Hub.

## Overview

- **Model**: LLaMA-3.1-8B with 4-bit quantization for efficient memory usage.
- **Techniques**: Fine-tuning using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, gradient checkpointing, and chat templates.
- **Data**: Custom local CSV file used for training.
- **Goal**: Train and deploy a chatbot model capable of handling user input in conversation-based formats.

## Features

- **LoRA Adapters**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
- **Quantization**: Efficient memory usage with 4-bit precision.
- **Chat Templates**: Structured conversation flow with tokenization.
- **Model Deployment**: Saving and pushing models to Hugging Face Hub in different quantization formats.
